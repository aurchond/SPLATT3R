  SPLATT3R! is a multi-directional shooter video arcade game, loosely based on the 1980
video game “Berzerk”. In the game, a gun, controlled by the player, is controlled using the
arrow keys. 

  The player can also shoot at monsters by pressing the spacebar, and if they are
killed they “splatter” into a pile of slime, hence the name of the game itself.
The monsters also shoot at the player if they get within a certain range of them, and will
try to bring to the player’s health down to 0 by following them around and shooting them. The
player wins the game if they shoot and kill all the monsters, and they lose the game if their
health gets taken down to 0.

  The game can be paused by pressing down the ‘p’ key and can be restarted at any time
using the ‘r’ key, resetting the player’s positions, health and the positions of all robots.
